It is crucial that equipment be appropriately set up to ensure maximum consistency among surveys and to facilitate gear replacement where/when necessary. Key components for a pelagic BRUV are listed in Table 6.3.

Equipment configurations can vary among terrains, bathomes and as a function of study objectives (Figure 6.1). For instance, Santana-Garcon_ et al._ (2014b)'s design is remarkably stable compared to Letessier_ et al._ (2013b) but is constrained by the need to moor, which Bouchet & Meeuwig (2015)'s design bypasses. Likewise, bait arm length is usually variable, and may be reduced under turbid conditions to optimise species identification capacity.

Figure 6.1 Examples of possible deployment configurations for pelagic BRUV sampling. Schematics extracted from or as used in (A) Santana-Garcon_ et al._ (2014b), (B) Schifiliti_ et al._ (2014) and Kempster_ et al._ (2016), (C) Letessier_ et al._ (2013b). Cameras can be either forward-facing (A, C) or downward-facing (B). The anchored design shown in C was adapted in Bouchet & Meeuwig (2015) to let BRUV units drift freely.
