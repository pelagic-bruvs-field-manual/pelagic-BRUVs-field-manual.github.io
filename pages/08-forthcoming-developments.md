The development of novel methods combining pelagic BRUVs with ancillary data streams from other sampling platforms is currently underway. This includes, for instance, the integration of species size distributions as observed on BRUVs with active acoustics (echosounder data at 38 kHz) as a means of improving estimates of fish biomass. See the following publication for more details:

Letessier TB, Proud R, Meeuwig JJ, Cox M, Cattaneo Fernandes M, Brierley AS. (Submitted) A protocol for estimating fish biomass using echosounders and baited stereo-videography. Methods in Ecology & Evolution.
